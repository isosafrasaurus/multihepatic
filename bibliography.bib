abstract="In numerous applications the mathematical model consists of different processes coupled across a lower dimensional manifold. Due to the multiscale coupling, finite element discretization of such models presents a challenge. Assuming that only singlescale finite element forms can be assembled we present here a simple algorithm for representing multiscale models as linear operators suitable for Krylov methods. Flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by numerical examples with coupling across dimensionality gap 1 and 2. Preconditioners for several of the problems are discussed.",
