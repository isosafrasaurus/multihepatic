# Instructions
### Via Docker
1. `docker pull` the most recent 3d-1d package
2. `docker run` the image with `-p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888` to expose the Jupyter port, and optionally mount a local directory on your host machine to `/root/3d-1d/export` to receive ParaView files

### Via Linux and Python venv
This will allow you to run the repo natively on your Linux machine. First, install legacy DOLFIN/FEniCS on your system via
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fenics
```
Then, create a `venv` with the `--system-site-packages` option and run the following shell script within the venv
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
    
bin/pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy networkx plotly jupyter ipykernel tqdm ipywidgets vtk meshio pyvista Rtree

git clone "https://bitbucket.org/fenics-apps/cbc.block/src/master/"
bin/pip install master/

git clone --single-branch -b "collapse-iter-dev" "https://github.com/MiroK/fenics_ii"
find fenics_ii/ -type f -name "*.py" -exec perl -pi -e 's/\bufl\b/ufl_legacy/g' {} +
bin/pip install fenics_ii/

git clone "https://github.com/IngeborgGjerde/graphnics"
bin/pip install graphnics/

bin/pip install git+https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint.git --upgrade
```
Then, you must register the kernel. Run `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<your_venv_kernel_name> --display-name="Python (<your_venv_name>)"`

### Via Google Colab
KSPSolve can sometimes run out of memory. If your computer has RAM limitations, follow these instructions to run the demo notebook on Google Colab instead.
1. Download and copy repo contents to Google Drive at address `d`
2. Run a cell consisting of
```
import sys, os
WORK_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/<d>"
SOURCE_PATH = os.path.join(WORK_PATH, "src")
sys.path.append(SOURCE_PATH)

!pip install ipywidgets vtk meshio pyvista Rtree

def replace_in_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Replace 'ufl' with 'ufl_legacy'
    content = re.sub(r'\bufl\b', 'ufl_legacy', content)

    with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(content)

def process_directory(directory):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                replace_in_file(file_path)

abstract="In numerous applications the mathematical model consists of different processes coupled across a lower dimensional manifold. Due to the multiscale coupling, finite element discretization of such models presents a challenge. Assuming that only singlescale finite element forms can be assembled we present here a simple algorithm for representing multiscale models as linear operators suitable for Krylov methods. Flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by numerical examples with coupling across dimensionality gap 1 and 2. Preconditioners for several of the problems are discussed.",
